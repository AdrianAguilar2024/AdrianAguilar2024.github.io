## Project Purpose and Philosophy

In today's world, there are many drag-and-drop website builders. I chose to build this portfolio from scratch using fundamental web technologies for several key reasons:

1.  **To Demonstrate Foundational Skills:** This project showcases my proficiency in **HTML5** and **CSS3**, the core building blocks of the entire web. It proves I understand how to structure content and apply custom styling.
2.  **To Leverage Version Control:** The entire history of this website is tracked using **Git**. This demonstrates my comfort with version control best practices, including committing changes and pushing to a remote repository.
3.  **To Utilize Free, Powerful Hosting:** The site is hosted using **GitHub Pages**, a robust and completely free platform for static websites. This choice demonstrates resourcefulness and a practical understanding of the tools available in the developer ecosystem.
4.  **To Maintain Full Control:** By writing the code myself, I have 100% control over the design, layout, and functionality without being limited by a third-party platform's templates or restrictions.

This repository isn't just a website; it's a testament to my belief in understanding the fundamentals and using the right tools for the job.

## Technology Stack

*   **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the website.
*   **CSS3:** For all custom styling, layout, and design.
*   **Git & GitHub:** For version control and repository management.
*   **GitHub Pages:** For hosting the live static site.

## Website Features

The website is designed to be a clean, single-page portfolio that includes:
*   A professional header with my name, title, and logo.
*   An "About Me" section to introduce myself.
*   A "My Projects" section to showcase my work, with links to the relevant GitHub repositories.
*   A "Skills" section to highlight my technical abilities.
*   A "Contact Me" section with links to my professional profiles.

## How to Update the Website

This repository is the single source of truth for the live site. To make updates:

1.  Clone the repository to a local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AdrianAguilar2024/AdrianAguilar2024.github.io.git
    ```
2.  Make changes to the `index.html` (for content) or `style.css` (for design) files.
3.  Commit the changes with a clear message.
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Update project section with new bot"
    ```
4.  Push the changes back to the `main` branch on GitHub.
    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```
GitHub Pages will automatically detect the push and deploy the new version of the site within a minute or two.

## Future Development

I plan to continue iterating on this site as my skills grow. Potential future improvements include:
*   Adding a blog section to document my learning journey.
*   Implementing a more responsive design for a better mobile experience.
*   Adding a contact form using a serverless function.
